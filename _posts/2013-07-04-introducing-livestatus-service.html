<h2>Automate!</h2>
<p>
When trying to <em>automate everything</em> sometimes the tools you use can hold
you back. An example is monitoring, where old systems (like nagios) are difficult
to automate because they have no remote control API.
</p>

<h2>Using MK-livestatus</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://mathias-kettner.de/checkmk_livestatus.html">MK-livestatus</a> is an extension for Nagios/Icinga (and built-in for Shinken)
that allows retrieving information or sending commands via an <em>Unix Domain Socket (UDS)</em>.
</p>
<h3>Livestatus is cool</h3>

Information from nagios itself comes from a file named <em>status.dat</em> which
is updated every <code>x</code> seconds (where <code>x</code> can be configured
but usually has a value of 5-10). Thus having real-time information from
livestatus is very useful.<br/>
As the name <strong>live</strong>status hints, the information retrieved and sent using
livestatus is always up-to-date. Livestatus does this by directly retrieving the in-memory
information using the broker API.

<h3>The problems</h3>
<h4><em>Unix Domain Socket</em> means you need local access</h4>
<p>
The MK-livestatus page suggests either using SSH or <em>xinetd</em>
to expose the socket to the network.
While exposing the socket over TCP is a security nightmare, both suggestions
have another issue in common!
</p>

<h4>You have to deal with the output format from MK-livestatus</h4>
<p>
The output format from MK-livestatus is not very pleasant to work with.
For example if you ask for JSON, you'll get something like</br>
<code>[['field1', 'field2', 'field3'],</br>
       ['value1', 'value2', 'value3']]</code></br>
Basically the first list is the list of column names, and then you get a list
with the values for every row.
If you restrict the displayed columns like so :</br>
<code>Columns: field_1 field_2</code></br>
you'd just get</br>
<code>[['value1', 'value2']]</code></br>
so get ready to parse your own query.</br></br>
<strong>Awesome, right?</strong>
</p>

<h2>Introducing livestatus-service</h2>
<h3>What it does for you</h3>
<p>
Wouldn't it be nice to access the livestatus API over HTTP (being able to build in
authentication and so on) and at the same time get cool responses like:</br>
<code>[{'field1': 'value1', 'field2': 'value2', 'field3': 'value3'}]</code>?</br>
With livestatus-service, this is possible. You can even select an index (say <em>field1</em>)
and get something like</br>
<code>{'value1' : {'field1': 'value1', 'field2': 'value2', 'field3': 'value3'}}</code></br>
